Dear Sir or Madam,

**Emma Elley**

I have known Emma from her undergraduate days, when she undertook a research project as part of an education elective in fourth year. Not long after that, she successfully studied a PGDE in Physics and Mathematics, graduating and provisionally registering with the GTCS. I was her physics tutor on the PGDE and got to know her individually and as part of the cohort during her year at Moray House.

Emma displayed elegant intellect as a student by being articulate and fully engaged in her studies. She read widely, conducted her professional enquiry diligently and worked with her peers and colleagues on placement with a professional outlook. She faced challenge boldly and listened carefully to feedback and advice, taking appropriate action to address development areas and humbly accepting praise. Of particular note was her ability to work with others: whether as group lead or as collaborator, Emma had sufficient confidence to guide and progress the task at the same time as ensuring team members had the chance to contribute. When faced with challenges, she sought guidance and support from the right places, deploying tact and diplomacy, or firm, polite assertiveness when required.

Without doubt, Emma will be a valuable contributor to whatever venture she embarks on. Whilst I am disappointed that she will not yet be a Physics and Mathematics teacher, I am confident that she will impress in her new area of commitment. I endorse her to your programme and wish her every success.

Your sincerely
